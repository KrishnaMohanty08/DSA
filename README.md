# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java

Welcome to my Java-focused Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This collection contains fundamental DSA concepts and implementations, designed to build a solid foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of key data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, heaps, and more in Java.
- **Algorithms**: Core algorithms covering sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, graph traversal, backtracking, and other techniques.
- **Practice Problems**: Solutions from platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank to reinforce DSA concepts.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Notes on time and space complexity to aid in code optimization.

## Features

- **Java Implementations**: All code is written in Java for consistency and depth.
- **Detailed Code Comments**: Explanations alongside the code for easier understanding.
- **Problem Examples**: Includes example problems with solutions to practice DSA concepts.
